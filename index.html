            <br>
            Hello!  I'm Asenguah Gaius, a passionate software engineering student at Lead City University. I have a deep love for creating innovative digital solutions and solving complex problems through coding. <br>
             Alongside my programming skills, I’m also an aspiring graphic designer with a few years of experience, constantly working to refine my craft. <br>
            Beyond my technical interests, I’ve always been drawn to football, a sport that’s been a significant part of my life since childhood, and remains my favorite. Football not only fuels my competitive spirit but also helps me value teamwork and strategy. <br><br>
            In addition to coding and design, I have a keen interest in music. Whether listening to different genres or exploring musical rhythms, music is a source of inspiration and creativity for me.
             I’m always eager to learn, grow, and contribute, whether in the tech world, design, or in pursuing my passions outside of it.
              <br><br>
